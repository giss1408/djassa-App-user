# Create this app's release signing key, once, and print what GitHub needs.

# Usage: scripts/create-signing-key.sh
#
# The key is what lets testers install an UPDATE over the previous version:
# Android refuses an update signed with a different key. Lose it and every
# tester must uninstall and reinstall. So:
#   1. Run this once, on your own machine (needs a JDK for keytool).
#   2. Save the .jks file and the password in a password manager.
#   3. Paste the four printed values into GitHub: repository Settings →
#      Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.
# Never commit the .jks or the password. To test a password later, use
# scripts/check-signing-key.sh (not keytool's own prompt).
