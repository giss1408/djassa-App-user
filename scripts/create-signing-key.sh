# The key is what lets testers install an UPDATE over the previous version:
# Android refuses an update signed with another key. So after running this:
#   1. Copy the four values from the secrets file into GitHub: repository
#      Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.
#   2. Keep the .jks and its password in a password manager (done for you if
#      `pass` is installed), then delete the secrets file.
#   3. Check anytime with scripts/check-signing-key.sh.
# Never commit the .jks, the password or the secrets file.
